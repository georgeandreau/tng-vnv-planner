## What it is

The Planner acts as the main manager for the V&V test requests. It is responsible for test plans management, sequencing, and triggering requests of the corresponding test requests. Although the Planner is responsible for overall test activity, execution of individual test plans is given over to the curator and executor.
An outline of the architecture is shown below.

* clean : clean the project build directory
* compile code
* process resources
* package jar
* compile test
* process test resources
* execute test
